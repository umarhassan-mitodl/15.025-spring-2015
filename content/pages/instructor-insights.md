**Course Outcomes for Learners**

We've gathered these intended learning outcomes from your course materials. Would you like to make any revisions or additions?

· Use game theory to enhance your ability to think strategically in complex, interactive environments

· Learn fundamental game theory concepts, such as rationality, equilibrium, predicting outcomes and influencing outcomes

· Understand game theory’s application in “big” domains, such as long-run relationships, designing and auctioning markets, and credibility and reputation 

· Apply understanding of game theory to give strategic advice to one or more players in a real-world game situation

**Student Description**

Who were your students? Were students from one or more particular Sloan programs? What previous experiences did students have with game theory prior to the class?

**Instructor Insights**

In your syllabus, you note that you use an interactive approach to teaching the course that includes in-class games and discussion of take-home games. Please tell us about your decision to teach the course interactively. How do you facilitate in-class games when the class size is large (more than 70 students!)? What does teaching through in-class games allow you to do pedagogically? Do students seem to engage with this kind of learning? 

In what ways did anchoring the learning of game theory in real-world examples accelerate learning and/or motivate students? In what ways did it present challenges? Would you recommend that other educators use real-world examples when teaching about game theory?

Relatedly, please share your insights about teaching through case studies. What do you consider when selecting cases? How do you facilitate productive discussions about cases?

The team project is a major component of the course. Please tell us about the brainstorming sessions you held with teams. Would you recommend other educators try something like this? 

Similarly, what insights do you have about the ways in which teams provided each other with peer feedback on their projects? Was this process productive? What, if anything, would make it better next time?

What else might you like to change about the project assignment the next time you teach the course?

This was a complex course. What would you like to add that we have not yet asked?
